Enumeration of actions that a client of the \hyperlink{classcaffe_1_1Solver}{Solver} may request by implementing the \hyperlink{classcaffe_1_1Solver}{Solver}\textquotesingle{}s action request function, which a client may optionally provide in order to request early termination or saving a snapshot without exiting. In the executable caffe, this mechanism is used to allow the snapshot to be saved when stopping execution with a S\+I\+G\+I\+NT (Ctrl-\/C).
